#  Ruby on Rails Consulting

Yoosuf has worked with Ruby on Rails technology since 2009 (Ruby on Rails version 2) and having hands on experience for past five years. Yoosuf has developed and deployed a dozen of applications developed based on Rails, PG and MongoDB. Each application has been developed with TDD and BDD. Additionally each of thease apps are developed following the incremental **agile** approach.

Do you want a need for a MVP, a total back-end solution, an API  for mobile or review the existing project?  [Please send me a message](/contact/?utm_source=yoosuf.me&utm_medium=ror&utm_campaign=consultancy), I can give you a free quote.
