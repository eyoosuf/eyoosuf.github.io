Today got a chance to see the mobile safari’s “Shared links” section and came across few tweets and stories from the social media. Then got the chance to see some of the interesting tweets about Brussels attack and made me to think the terror suspects were from Sri Lanka. But then realized DailyMirror.lk are using social media in a wrong manner. Using wrong hash tag for a wrong news item, which is not a crime, but a little childish.
