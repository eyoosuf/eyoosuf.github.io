Today at Apple event Apple.inc announced the new product line and also introduced the new softwares. In that lineups at of the productive apps and the Maravicks OSX are announced as free. This is the first time ever a high reputable company announced the software for free. By doing this action it's really worth for the users as well as hopefully they might be expecting a raise in the sales. Hopefully they are going to achieve it without an issue.
