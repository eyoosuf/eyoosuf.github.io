<a href="https://github.com/eyoosuf/jqModal" target="_blank">jqModal</a> is one of the simple and light weighted jquery plug-in to create modal windows in your web browser without a hassle, recently when i was using jqModel with the latest version of the jQuery,  I found an issue saying <code>undefined error</code> and realised jQuery library has been updated with many refractions and many feature drops for Microsoft Internet Explore's older versions. hence I decided to change the code and republish it in my <a href="https://github.com/eyoosuf/" target="_blank">github</a> for the public use. Fork it, try it out and send pull requests, I will happily update the repository.
