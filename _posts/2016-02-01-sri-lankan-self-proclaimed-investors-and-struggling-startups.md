In April 2015, myself and my friend (who is a mobile app developer) got a chance to meet an interesting guy who was aged somewhere around 53. He introduced his self to us as <em><strong>Dino</strong></em> and asked about ourselves, about the technology stack we use and how do we develop applications and back and forth. And finally he mentioned he wanted to start build a taxi hailing application something similar to Uber or Grab a taxi. On that time PickMe wasn't introduced and Uber was announcing a job opportunity for a country manager.

Let's continue with my side of the story about starting up a business with self-proclaimed investor and where the things I got messed up. I took that as an opportunity to quit what I did (as a senior software engineer at a small mobile app development agency) and went along to face the challenge, which is to start myself as an entrepreneur. After taking up with that challenge I was introduced to a company who are having pretty decent track record. I was introduced to them and later my "startup" vision is totally changed. We were requested to do the mobile app as developers, the conditions before startingÂ the project were, we cannot reveal the name of the company or product we've worked on and so on was in the NDA.

Initially it was bit of a disappointment for me. I was starting with a dream to start a company. Since I was with a co-founder, he was okay with the idea of creating an agency model. Then I decided to stick around and do something till we make the application that would change us from agency model business to a proper startup model. Initially I was started working with a little a disappointment, although we had a project to carry on with. My guys started working with the Application development straight away from the mockups that we received. Since it's a taxi hailing app and starting from scratch we started with the driver app. Then after plenty of pixel perfect testing we went along with the passenger app for the iOS and Android. Since it was just a beginning we all enjoyed doing it.

The rest of the struggle will be published next week.
