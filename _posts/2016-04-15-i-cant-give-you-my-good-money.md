This is the true incident, my self and a well experienced entrepreneur in Sri Lanka caught up with this specific fake investor. The investor also have a bogus company sounds like a venture capital firm.
So I believe you got an understanding of how we got the investment and how we continued with the operation.

After plenty of cold emails, I escalated this issue for the Investor saying “we haven’t got an investment according to the MOU, we may need an investment to continue further” then the investor started saying “you are all doing wrong, including for the sub contracted Taxi hailing App development and other sub contracted development projects you guys quoted wrong. And you guys are not approching any direct clients, so I can’t give you my good money”.

That reply strucked me for a while, we were as a team quit our jobs, and wanted to focus on one thing and that’s why we were after an investor to get mentorship, and to start with the business and grow along. Not just to come and say in the last moment that we are all doing wrong. Doing mistakes is part of business and learning from it is also a part of the game.

Things became very complected, this became a very risky point for our day today life, even we didn’t have a very good starting point in the new year, we were financially screwed. The team broken apart to continue on own things.

As last thing by the involvement of a guy who is well known for the investor we did few measures to get back the money we deposited for the investors account.

We learned a very good lesson dealing with this fraud investor. Loosing pile of time and career. The soon after publishing this story, got plenty of emails saying similar story with the same guy. I personally believe I did my best work publishing this, because in future someone search for Mr. Dino, they are surely going to know who he is before committing for a stupid decision and before day dream about somebody like Mr. Dino investment.
