OSX Mavericks Finder Tabbing Feature is an interesting announcement by Apple.inc but unfortunately i am not enjoying that much because of some issues with User Experience.

P.S. While doing this video I didn't notice the Merge all windows feature, and finally after stumbleupon the youtube found it, there is a feature called "<strong>Merge all windows</strong>" under the <strong>Window Menu</strong>.
