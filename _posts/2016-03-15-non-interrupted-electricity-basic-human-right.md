The horrible dark history of Sri Lanka continues, Just couple of years ago we had worst ever war in place and it created a worst stain over Sri Lanka's name and its reputation. And now it continues in a horrible format, which is the power cut. Some irresponsible Engineer, Officers blame each other and some politicians trying to take greatest advantage of this to their political survival, which is indeed a horrible act.

Why the Electricity is a basic Human right? first and foremost We work because of electricity and whatever we do is based on electricity.  Having electricity is not a luxury need of a human, but it is a basic human right.  Now the life has changed, we are not living in 1950's to spend the night with candles and type on a typewriter to create letters and send via postal mail.
<blockquote>If I am in an environment with trees and plans around me, I'd not even bother about electricity outages.</blockquote>
We are in 2016, houses are build close to each other, some selfish people cut the tree and try to expand the building they live and some even try to build a shop or a garage for a daily survival. Just think about the life without electricity in such environment.  Which is a total nightmare.

Additionally from Sri Lanka's municipal council to Central Government making a environment disaster by just allowing business establishments to build huge buildings. The land price has gone so high than ever, anyone who buys the land wanted to build a huge building and trying to make an income, which is reasonable enough. but when approving such building plans why not audit the construction site? Sri Lankan government and local governments should enforce a national policy, rather just approving building plans just to make money, Please follow a national policy which to protect the environment for today and tomorrow!.

According to my understanding the Dehiwala Mt. Lavinia local government one of the worst and is just out of control. I would rather say it is very politicalised. People who works for the Mayor or has influence, get an opportunity to start a garage or a shop anywhere with an illegal establishment without even environment check. Usually when starting a garage or a business which creates a problem for the resident should not be allowed in a residential area. or there should be a minimum need to start a garage business. Sri Lankans are very lucky they can start any sort of business where ever they want. and people who are very greedy for money are don't care about environment or the disturbance for anyone, they just start operation.

Such environment disaster should be stopped immediately, if such things continuities, I am not sure where are we going to be in 20 years?

Dear Government of Sri Lanaka, please take immediate action to protect the environment, every district, every city, every homes should be taken to the consideration. If there are any illegal buildings destroy them, if houses build without plants, put the pressure of tax and when someone who wants to build a building by cutting a Tree? just stop them, don't allow them to build a building, house or a religious establishment.

I am unable to make upper voice on regard of this matter, I am not wealth enough and I don't have the political influence to take this message to the higher authority, I believe someone who reads this will take this message to Mr. President or the Prime minister of Sri Lanka.
