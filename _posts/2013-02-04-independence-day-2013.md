Today Sri Lankans are celebrating the 65th independence day. Happy independence day for all Sri Lankan's. Basically Sri Lankan's got the freedom from British empire to be independent in politics, administration, finance and much moreâ€¦. After years Google has updated its doodle for the first time in google.lk page and here it is.
