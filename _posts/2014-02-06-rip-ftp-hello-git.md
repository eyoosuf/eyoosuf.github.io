<a title="File Transfer Protocol on Wikipedia" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol" target="_blank">FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</a> is been there since the internet was invented, the real need of FTP was started in 1990' along side the birth with the World Wide Web. in early stage the Websites were build and published via FTP and yet today several developers and designers are building and deploying the applications and websites via FTP. all though the FTP has several issues. FTP is exceptionally slow, it is totally depends of the speed of the internet and it and it has several request and responses to done to accomplish the basic file transfer.

Here's a video shows how a FTP, FTP client works.

But later on, the domination of <a title="Read more about Git on Wikipedia " href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)" target="_blank">GIT</a> is spreading among the developers, indeed I am too. GIT is using it's own protocol and which is significantly very faster than the FTP, and GIT was totally developed for faster version controlling. Now a days no one is developing HTML website, where as everyone is building CMS websites, because time has been changed. when depending on FTP, the file transfer form client to server will take ages, hence using a intermediate GIT to deploy the website/web apps will help the developers to faster deployment and will help to transfer files without loosing, wen breaking of a internet connection.

Believe there will be a simplified steps for non developers near future. Probably you will notice the different between the voice. FTP sounds so old, and git sounds so energetic and young. So it is time to say RIP for FTP. Unless if you are working on small projects.
