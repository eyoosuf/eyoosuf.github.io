That time when I was trying participate to it, absolutely got no chance to do it, all thought this year, I am going to do it and just taking this as a challenge. I am trying to achieve something through the growth of the mustache.  Obviously the blessings would be appreciated. Additionally, after trying several website that just made for collection donations seems not accepting Sri Lanka address, hence I am planning to add a donation form down below during this weekend, this form will be active till the November 30, 2013. The total amount of donation will be given to the National Cancer Trust of Sri Lanka.

PS. Movember collection was 8975/= Sri Lankan Rupees (Approximatly  $60) will be donated as 10000/=(Sri Lankan rupees)  to Sri Lanka Cancer Research Institute.
