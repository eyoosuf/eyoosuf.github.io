Yesterday the Hoefler & Frere-Jones announced the cloud typography ( web fonts service as Typekit service). The things I really I love about Hoefler & Frere-Jones is they got only a few range of fonts, but excellent typefaces. For an example the **Achar** one of the best font choice for print and web ( my personal preference). 

The cost of the web font service is bit pricey than the other web font service providers, but yet Hoefler & Frere-Jones are having the best font choices, hence it's worth for the money. In addition, I really wish some of the famous typefaces such should be in there library, that would help the web designers to mix the font in the design rather sticking for one single or some specific font types. I hope they will provide a very good service for the web, the community and the website users.
